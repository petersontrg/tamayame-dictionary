  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Intransitive Verb Classes in Tamayame</h1>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Intransitive verbs in Tamayame are grouped into formal classes based on the pronominal prefixes (PRMPs) they take. These classes reflect which person/number combinations the verb occurs with in real usage, and are essential for capturing affix distribution, especially for verbs that exhibit number-marked patterns.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Class Codes</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Most intransitive verb classes are represented by a two-part code: <code>X–Y</code>. The first number (X) identifies the affix set used for:
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm mb-2">
      <li>3rd person subject (affix 121–126)</li>
      <li>1st person negative (affix 102)</li>
      <li>2nd person negative hortative (affix 115)</li>
    </ul>
    The second number (Y) identifies the set of affixes used for 1st and 2nd person forms (affixes 101, 103, 104, etc.).
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    For example, Class <code>1–3</code> uses 3rd person affixes from group 1, and 1st/2nd person affixes from group 3. These class labels appear on entry pages to indicate how the verb behaves morphologically.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Number-Based Usage</h2>
  <p class="mb-2">
    Each verb class is used in a specific number context — singular, dual, plural, or a combination:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm mb-4">
    <li><strong>Singular-only:</strong> 1–1, 1–3, 4–5, 6–3, 7–13, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Dual-only:</strong> 2–24, 10–22, 11–26, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Plural-only:</strong> 1–17, 5–9, 10–21, 14–19, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed usage:</strong> Class 3–27 occurs in all three numbers; 11–25 is used in both singular and plural.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    For many verbs, these class patterns correlate across number. For example:
  </p>
  <div class="text-sm ml-4">
    <p>• 1–1 (singular), 1–18 (dual), 1–17 (plural)</p>
    <p>• 5–8 (singular), 5–10 (dual), 5–9 (plural)</p>
    <p>• 10–7 (singular), 10–22 (dual), 10–21 (plural)</p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Semantic and Structural Notes</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Verbs are classified based on the actual affixes with which they occur. This means some verbs will be limited to certain forms — for example, only third person or only singular. Class membership does not imply the verb must occur with the full range of affixes in the paradigm.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Some classes (like 7–15) are specialized for kinship, possession, or other semantically limited stems. Others allow benefactive transitivization, meaning they are cross-linked to a transitive verb class.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Database Modeling</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    In the dictionary, each intransitive class is linked to two affix groups internally and labeled with its class code. Entries show the number usage and the associated TA marker (if applicable), helping identify stems that follow regular number-marked alternation or display exceptional paradigmatic gaps.
